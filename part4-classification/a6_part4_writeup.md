After completing `a6_part4.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Comment out the StandardScaler and re-run your test. How accurate is the model? Why is that?
much less accurate, as it now has mistakes, which it didn't make previously. This is because it is now weighing information differently, so it will get different results.
2. How accurate is the model with the StandardScaler? Is this model accurate enough for the given use case? Explain.
100% accurate with the situations that it ran, so it is accurate enough.
3. Looking at the predicted and actual results, how did the model do? Was there a pattern to the inputs that the model was incorrect about?
the model did good, the model was not incorrect about patterns.
4. Would a 34 year old Female who makes 56000 a year buy an SUV according to the model? Remember to scale the data before running it through the model.
